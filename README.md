### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Elys Network
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust/CosmWasm
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on inter-chain dApps
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first decentralized application (dApp) was a game called "CryptoKitties" that was built on the Ethereum blockchain in 2015.

Welcome to my portfolio! I go by the name of Cosmic Vagabond and I am a decentralized systems engineer with a focus on Cosmos SDK. I have a passion for building applications that promote user sovereignty and security on the blockchain.

I have worked on a variety of projects using the Cosmos SDK, ranging from decentralized exchanges to prediction markets. I am constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest developments in the Cosmos ecosystem.

In my free time, you can find me exploring the vast Cosmos and contributing to open source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and always enjoy working with others to bring new ideas to life.

Thank you for visiting my github profile. I hope you find my work interesting and I look forward to connecting with others in the blockchain community.
